      description: |
        After automatically annotating your genome using Prokka or Maker, it is important to visualize your results so you can understand what your organism
        looks like, and then to manually refine these annotations along with any additional data you might have. This process is most often done as part of
        a group, smaller organisms may be annotated individually though.
        <br><br>
        Apollo ([Dunn et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006790)) provides a platform to do this. It is a web-based, collaborative genome annotation editor. Think of it as “Google Docs”
        for genome annotation, multiple users can work together simultaneously to curate evidences and annotate a genome.
        <br><br>
        This tutorial is inspired by the [Apollo User’s Guide](https://genomearchitect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UsersGuide.html), which provides additional guidance.

      description: |
         In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly
         packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A
         nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is
         wrapped with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed
         into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome
         complex. Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position
         of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role
         in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these
         factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of
         genes. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing
         (ATAC-Seq) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin
         and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene
         expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and
         potential enhancers and silencers.

      description: |

        <img alt="ncbi logo" src="https://uribeconvers.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ncbi.png" width="10%" style="float: right"/> Traditionally, after a list of run accessions has been filtered on the NCBI website, the accessions are used to download and extract fastq using the SRA toolkit to enter into the next steps of the workflow.  A newer compressed data type generated from raw submission data for sequences containing hits to SARS-CoV-2 is also accessible to Galaxy users from SRA in the Cloud.

        SRA Aligned Read Format (SARFs) provides further output options other than basic FASTQ format, for example:
        1. contigs created from the raw reads in the run (FASTA format)
        2. reads aligned back to the contigs (SAM format)
        3. VCF files generated for each record relative to the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq record.

        We will demonstrate how to access just the reads (FASTA or FASTQ format), just the contigs, the reads aligned to the contigs and VCF files for selected SARFs. These formats can speed up workflows such as assembly and variant calling, and this data format is still referenced by the run accession and accessed using the SRA toolkit.

        This workshop describes the SARF data objects and demonstrates a few ways to filter them using the metadata before accessing them and entering them into Galaxy workflows.

        A volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of
        change (fold change). It enables quick visual identification of genes with large fold changes that are also
        statistically significant. These tutorials will first teach you how to create such plots from your RNA-Seq results
        in Galaxy, and then how you can further customized the plots using R directly within Galaxy.

        you’ve been threatened with learning Python to do so! Well, fear not. If you can have a run-through of a basic python coding introduction,
        then that will help you make more sense of this tutorial, however you’ll be able to make and interpret glorious plots
        even without understanding the Python coding language. This is the beauty of Galaxy - all the ‘set-up’ is identical across computers,
        because it’s browser based. So fear not!

        with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels)and transcript
        assemblies (splicing variants). This database can then be used to identify protein sequence
        variants from the mass spectrometry data.

      description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply multiple classification algorithms on the Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) dataset to predict the biodegradable activity of chemical compounds. QSAR models attempt to predict the activity or property of chemicals based on their chemical structure. To achieve this, a database of compounds is collected for which the property of interest is known. For each compound, molecular descriptors are collected which describe the structure (for example - molecular weight, number of nitrogen atoms, number of carbon-carbon double bonds). Using these descriptors, a model is constructed which is capable of predicting the property of interest for a new, unknown molecule. In this tutorial, we will use a database assembled from experimental data of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to create a classification model by applying simple and complex classifiers to learn the nature of biodegradation. We will use this model to classify new molecules into one of two classes - biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Different visualisations are used to analyze the results after applying each classification algorithm. Hyperparameters of one of the classifiers are also optimised.

      description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply multiple regression algorithms on the DNA-methylation dataset to predict biological age. In this tutorial, we will build a regression model for chronological age prediction, based on DNA methylation. This is based on the work of Jana Naue et al. 2017, in which biomarkers are examined to predict the chronological age of humans by analyzing the DNA methylation patterns. Different machine learning algorithms are used in this study to make an age prediction. It has been recognized that within each individual, the level of DNA methylation changes with age. This knowledge is used to select useful biomarkers from DNA methylation datasets. The CpG sites with the highest correlation to age are selected as the biomarkers (and therefore features for building a regression model). In this tutorial, specific biomarkers are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to create an age prediction model. Multiple visualisations are also used to analyse the predictions made by simple and complex regressors and hyperparameters of one of the regressors also optimised.

        This is an Introduction to Machine Learning in R, in which you’ll learn the basics of unsupervised learning for pattern recognition and
        supervised learning for prediction. At the end of this workshop, we hope that you will
          - appreciate the importance of performing exploratory data analysis (or EDA) before starting to model your data.
          - understand the basics of unsupervised learning and know the examples of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.
          - understand the basics of supervised learning for prediction and the differences between classification and regression.
          - understand modern machine learning techniques and principles, such as test train split, k-fold cross validation and regularization.
          - be able to write code to implement the above techniques and methodologies using R, caret and glmnet.

        We will not be focusing on the mathematical foundation for each of the methods and approaches we’ll be discussing. There are many resources
        that can provide this context, but for the purposes of this workshop we believe that they are beyond the scope.

    All these materials will remain online, so you can continue working on them for as
    long as you want. The only difference will be that you should ask your questions
    on the <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">GTN Gitter channel</a>, instead of Slack.
