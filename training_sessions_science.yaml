      description: |
         In many eukaryotic organisms, such as humans, the genome is tightly
         packed and organized with the help of nucleosomes (chromatin). A
         nucleosome is a complex formed by eight histone proteins that is
         wrapped with ~147bp of DNA. When the DNA is being actively transcribed
         into RNA, the DNA will be opened and loosened from the nucleosome
         complex. Many factors, such as the chromatin structure, the position
         of the nucleosomes, and histone modifications, play an important role
         in the organization and accessibility of the DNA. Consequently, these
         factors are also important for the activation and inactivation of
         genes. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing
         (ATAC-Seq) is a method to investigate the accessibility of chromatin
         and thus a method to determine regulatory mechanisms of gene
         expression. The method can help identify promoter regions and
         potential enhancers and silencers.

      description: |
        Traditionally, after a list of run accessions has been filtered on the NCBI website, the accessions are used to download and extract fastq using the SRA toolkit to enter into the next steps of the workflow.  A newer compressed data type generated from raw submission data for sequences containing hits to SARS-CoV-2 is also accessible to Galaxy users from SRA in the Cloud.
        <br/><br/>
        SRA Aligned Read Format (SARFs) provides further output options other than basic fastq format, for example 1) contigs created from the raw reads in the run (FASTA format), 2) reads aligned back to the contigs (SAM format), 3) VCF files generated for each record relative to the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq record.
        <br/><br/>
        We will demonstrate how to access just the reads (FASTA or FASTQ format), just the contigs, the reads aligned to the contigs and VCF files for selected SARFs. These formats can speed up workflows such as assembly and variant calling, and this data format is still referenced by the run accession and accessed using the SRA toolkit.
        <br/><br/>
        This workshop describes the SARF data objects and demonstrates a few ways to filter them using the metadata before accessing them and entering them into Galaxy workflows.

        sequence database using RNA-Seq data.  The resultant FASTA database contains sequences
        with single amino acid variants (SAVs), insertions and deletions (indels)and transcript
        assemblies (splicing variants). This database can then be used to identify protein sequence
        variants from the mass spectrometry data.

      description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply multiple classification algorithms on the Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) dataset to predict the biodegradable activity of chemical compounds. QSAR models attempt to predict the activity or property of chemicals based on their chemical structure. To achieve this, a database of compounds is collected for which the property of interest is known. For each compound, molecular descriptors are collected which describe the structure (for example - molecular weight, number of nitrogen atoms, number of carbon-carbon double bonds). Using these descriptors, a model is constructed which is capable of predicting the property of interest for a new, unknown molecule. In this tutorial, we will use a database assembled from experimental data of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to create a classification model by applying simple and complex classifiers to learn the nature of biodegradation. We will use this model to classify new molecules into one of two classes - biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Different visualisations are used to analyze the results after applying each classification algorithm. Hyperparameters of one of the classifiers are also optimised.

      description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply multiple regression algorithms on the DNA-methylation dataset to predict biological age. In this tutorial, we will build a regression model for chronological age prediction, based on DNA methylation. This is based on the work of Jana Naue et al. 2017, in which biomarkers are examined to predict the chronological age of humans by analyzing the DNA methylation patterns. Different machine learning algorithms are used in this study to make an age prediction. It has been recognized that within each individual, the level of DNA methylation changes with age. This knowledge is used to select useful biomarkers from DNA methylation datasets. The CpG sites with the highest correlation to age are selected as the biomarkers (and therefore features for building a regression model). In this tutorial, specific biomarkers are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to create an age prediction model. Multiple visualisations are also used to analyse the predictions made by simple and complex regressors and hyperparameters of one of the regressors also optimised.

  title: Galaxy for Non-Genomics
  description: Galaxy is widely used for analysis of genomics data, but is not limited to any scientific domain. This module covers some non-genomics topics such as Climate research and cheminformatics.
  sessions:
    - name: "Climate: Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES): Lecture"
      type: Lecture & Hands-on Tutorial
      description: "Terrestrial ecosystem models have been widely used to study the impact of climate changes on vegetation and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles in climate modelling community. They are also more and more applied in ecological studies to help ecologists to better understand the processes. But the technical challenges are still too high for most of the ecologists to use them. This practical aims at familiarizing you (especially ecologists) with running a terrestrial ecosystem model (i.e., CLM-FATES) at site-level in Galaxy and analyzing the model results."

    All these materials will remain online, so you can continue working on them for as
    long as you want. The only difference will be that you should ask your questions
    on the <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">GTN Gitter channel</a>, instead of Slack.
