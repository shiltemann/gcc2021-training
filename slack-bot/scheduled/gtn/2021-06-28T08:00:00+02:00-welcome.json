There are tutorials and recordings online, and you are free to go through these at your own pace.\n\nFor this training week there is *no fixed schedule*, instead we provide a set of modules for you to choose from.\n• This week YOU make the schedule, YOU decide which tutorials to follow, and when to start, stop, and take breaks. Find modules which are interesting to you.\n• New to Galaxy? We suggest you start with the 'Introduction to Galaxy' module, followed by the 'Introduction to NGS Analysis' module.\n• Unsure which tutorial to follow? Feel free to ask us for recommendations in Slack!"
