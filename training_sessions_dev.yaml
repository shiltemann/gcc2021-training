          **Why this training might be useful:** If you write useful scientific
          analysis scripts, but have not yet learned to create new tools for
          Galaxy, the ToolFactory might help.

          It generates the XML "wrapper" for any simple, working command line
          script. The script, I/O and parameters are specified using a Galaxy
          tool form. When the form is completed, the tool it specifies is
          generated and installed, ready to run in the local Galaxy server.

          If a generated tool might be useful to other users, it can be linted
          and tested, producing a toolshed-ready archive for sharing.

          **Training model and support:** The ToolFactory training is designed
          for asynchronous self guided study. Developers have widely varying
          needs and interests. The ToolFactory is adaptable to almost any of
          these if a script is ready to wrap. No formal presentations are
          planned but the developer will be available during designated
          sessions to answer questions and learn about new bugs.

          **Resources:**
          1. Hello Galaxy video demonstration 10m (TBA)
          2. Tutorial: ["hello Galaxy" tools](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-generators/tutorial.html)
          3. Tutorial: [Advanced features](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-generators-advanced/tutorial.html)
          4. Sample tools in the Appliance history: The best way to learn what the ToolFactory can do is to rerun them with changes to the script, I/O and parameters to suit your needs.
          5. The ToolFactory Appliance is a flavour of docker-galaxy-stable for your private workstation or high-end laptop. Installation and disposal are described in the introductory tutorial.

          **Prerequisites:** Linux shell and scripting skills are required. A
          dedicated, private Linux workstation or high-end laptop is needed for
          Appliance installation.

          The ToolFactory is recommended for private desktop use only because
          executing unrestricted user installed tools is an unacceptable
          potential security risk for any production server.
