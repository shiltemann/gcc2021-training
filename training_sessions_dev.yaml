    - name: "ToolFactory: Generating Tools From Simple Scripts"
      description: |
          Here you can learn about a specialised Galaxy tool that generates tool wrappers for supplied analysis scripts. Generated tools are immediately installed and ready to run,
          and can be edited and re-generated in Galaxy. It lacks many advanced features (e.g. filters) but is easy to learn to use for those useful
          scripts that do not require them. **Prerequisites:** Linux shell and scripting skills are required. A Linux/Docker workstation or
          high-end laptop is needed for Appliance installation.

          <br />
          <br />
          There are two hands-on tutorials associated with this session:

          1. Introductory hands-on DIY tutorial - obtaining the Appliance and creating "hello world" tools using the ToolFactory
          2. Exploring the demonstration tools in depth and some handy ToolFactory features. There is no particular curriculum - developers will want to explore their own needs. The Appliance encourages learning by doing. It provides instant feedback when a tool is (re)generated.
